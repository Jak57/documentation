## Paid Call Quality Comparison of Orbitalk and Brilliant Connect

## Goal
Compare the voice quality of Orbitalk and Brilliant Connect during the app to the GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) call.

## Experimental Setup
For experimenting with voice quality measurement two Android devices are needed. One device is the one from where a call will be made and that device must have Orbitalk and Brilliant Connect installed. The calling device will remain constant but the receiving device will vary. From the calling device, using Orbitalk or the Brilliant Connect app GSM call will be made to the receiving device. During the call, the participant who initiated the call will only speak using the Orbitalk or Brilliant Connect app. Voice will be processed by the app the will be sent to the receiving participant who is a GSM user.  

The receiving participant will observe the call and provide a rating from 1 - 5 (where 1 means bad quality and 5 means excellent quality). From the ratings of different calls Mean Opinion Score will be calculated.
